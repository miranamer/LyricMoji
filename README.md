# LyricMðŸ˜€ji

<h1>What Is LyricMoji</h1>
<p>LyricMoji is a React Game (Proof Of Concept) in which users are presented with incomplete lyrics and have to use emojis to fill in the missing parts. An AI model will then evaluate the similarity between the users' emoji sentence and the actual missing lyric. If correct, the user can progress until they lose 3 times or win. The user also has the ability to get the correct answer using the AI's answer along with an explanation. You can also click 'Reveal Artist' and 'Reveal Song' to reveal the artist and song respectively.</p>
